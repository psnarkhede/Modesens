## Tools Used

###### • Github for code collaboration.
###### • Slack and Zoom for communication.

## Learning
<p>We learned how a team works and how to efficiently communicate when working in a team. Each one of us learned to push our limits and work hard each day through all the problems we faced. Also, Each one of us learned how to be solution-oriented and try different methods to solve the problem rather than being stuck on that problem. Last, I would like to mention that all of us did our very best to create this project and we are thankful for the guidance and support our mentors provided us.</p>
